Survey Form â€“ First project for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification

This form is the first certification challenge project I completed for the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design Certification. I built the form within the parameters defined by the challenge instructions. I added a photo from Unsplash by downloading the photo, linking to it in the CSS stylesheet, uploading the project to GitHub, then linking to the photo in the freeCodeCamp development environment using a link to my GitHub pages site.

Although it wasn't a requirement for this challenge to make the site responsive, I chose to do make it responsive in order to get some practice. ðŸ˜€
